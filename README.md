# NoWayOut-Game (Public Repository)

A UI/UX-centered game development project for KSU SWE6783 - Team 1, Fall '22

NoWayOut is a simple 3D escape-puzzle themed game built in Unity, with a focus on quality in-game interactions and a good overall user experience. The initial version was developed in a few weeks after a brief introduction to Unity, and iterately improved based on student user feedback over the course of the semester.

The game was produced in part with reusable assets from the Unity platform, not all of which are open-source or distributed with a permissive-use license. As a result, the complete project cannot be uploaded to GitHub. However, there are some useful solutions which I wanted to share, in the event that anyone may find them useful. In the scripts directory, amongst other items, are custom solutions for:

	- Interacting with World Objects (Using Ray-Tracing!)
	- Initializing and Working with Global Variables
	- Implementing Conditional Puzzles
	- Inter-object Interaction (ex: Control Light w/Switch)
	- Dynamically Loading Scenes
	- Logging Game Data to File
	- Playing a Sound on Cue
	- Time-Limit Game and UI Logic
	- Implementing World-Altering Difficulty Settings
	- Embedding a URL in UI

Please note that there are some code remnants from the Unity FPS base which were used to get the project started and prototyped within its brief allowed development window.
